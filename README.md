# Multiple-choice Question webapp
This is a web app that lets users do multiple choice questions.
This python project uses a module named Flask to serve resources.

## Making your own
After downloading the files, put them in a folder.

Download Python 3 if you do not have it. Be sure to install pip while installing.

If you already have Python 3 but do not have pip, install pip.
For Debian or Debian based linux users, do: 
`sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip`

It is recommended that you put the project in a virtual environment.
If using a virtual environment, activate it.
Install the module Flask by doing `pip install flask`. If it does not work, do `pip3 install flask`. If it still does not work, be sure you have installed pip.

In your terminal/command prompt, navigate to the folder.
Execute the python program "sql_db_creator.py" by issuing the command:
- `python sql_db_creator.py` or `py sql_db_creator.py`(if you have enabled this alias) if you only have only one major version of Python.
- `python3 sql_db_creattor.py` if you have both major versions of Python.

Then, execute the python program "add_questions.py". If familar, you might want to change or add your own questions in this file.
- `python add_questions.py` or `py add_questions.py`(if you have enabled this alias) if you only have only one major version of Python.
- `python3 add_questions.py` if you have both major versions of Python.

Lastly, run "main.py".
- `python main.py` or `py main.py`(if you have enabled this alias) if you only have only one major version of Python.
- `python3 main.py` if you have both major versions of Python.

You should see a message ending with the likes of "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)".
Go to the link in your browser, and voil√†! The web app is running!

To close the web app go back to your terminal and press "Ctrl" and "C" at the same time.
